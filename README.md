I'm a passionate game developer specializing in Unreal Engine and C++. My focus is on creating performant gameplay systems, VR development, and implementing advanced game mechanics.

### ðŸŽ® My Projects

- **Drone Simulator** - A VR Drone simulator made for my final year project was to practise
  physics based programming and real world calculations. Also to research into VR controls
  and motion smoothing.

- **IdlFarming** - A farming simulator that was made in c++ for the CLI to practise game logic and get better
  at practising game logic. 

Currently using GitLab for my workflow for Meta Quest Development and general Unreal Engine projects.
